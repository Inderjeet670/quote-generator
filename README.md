This a quote generator I designed and structred using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

API I used is https://type.fit/api/quotes

Async funciton is used to fetch the quotes using fetch() function.

First a huge number of quotes is fetched from the server and then we extract a random quote from it using the MATH.random function

If author is not given, it shows "UNKNOWN" in the author name field.

The website is fully responsive.

Font size changes based on the device display size and the length of the quote being displayed.
